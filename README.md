# QR Code Based Attendance Tracking System

This repository contains two interrelated projects designed to streamline the student attendance tracking process using QR codes. The backend handles real-time attendance registration, while the frontend enables students to scan their unique QR codes for seamless tracking. Below, you'll find detailed descriptions and links to each of the individual repositories for the backend and frontend components

## Repositories

### 1. [QR Code-based Attendance System - Backend (Golang)](https://github.com/Afthaab/QR-Generator-Backend)
- **Description**: A Golang-based backend that generates unique QR codes for students and tracks attendance in real-time. The system supports efficient handling of attendance data and scalability for large numbers of students.
- **Technologies**: Go (Golang), REST API, JSON, QR Code generation

### 2. [QR Code-based Attendance System - Frontend](https://github.com/Afthaab/QR-Generator-UI)
- **Description**: A frontend web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows students to scan QR codes for attendance registration and provides an interface for both students and instructors.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, QR Code scanning

## Prerequisites To Intsall the Project
1. Install the leates version of Golang from [Golang's Official Website](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Clone the respositories.

   - Git Command to clone the Backend repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Afthaab/QR-Generator-Backend
    ```
   - Git Command to clone the Frontend repository:
